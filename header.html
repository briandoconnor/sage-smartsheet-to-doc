<h1>About</h1>

<p>The Data and Tooling (D&T) group is improving the way we track overall grant Aims, Sub-Aims, and Deliverables for grants we are funded to work on.  We use Smartsheet to link these to Jira/Github Epics which are then worked on by the various D&T Workstreams (FAIR Data and Data Processing and Engineering) through linked Stories and Sub-Tasks.</p>

<p>We generated the report below directly from our <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/3g7hp2QrjGgW3QrjH4QVHx7QjfWw2WXr7PG4vFq1">2022 Roadmap Smartsheet</a>… It’s been filtered by projects you are associated with as a PI, Co-PI, or Co-I.</p>

<p>There’s a lot here… and I get the asks below are going to take time and be a bit grueling.  But we really want to get better at tracking what each of the projects we support need from D&T quarter over quarter.</p>

<h2>The Ask</h2>

<p>Please:</p>

<ul>
<li>Review the <a href="https://app.smartsheet.com/sheets/3g7hp2QrjGgW3QrjH4QVHx7QjfWw2WXr7PG4vFq1">2022 Roadmap Smartsheet</a> as needed to get a birds eye view of your projects and associated D&T Deliverables </li>
<li>Use this document below to make changes and/or additions using “Suggesting” mode (we are asking you to make changes via this Google since Smartsheet is 1) hard to enter descriptions/definitions of done and 2) really horrible for having multiple people edit simultaneously, often times you will overwrite someone else!!)</li>
<li>Look for 1) if we are missing any of your projects that D&T does work for  2)  if we are missing deliverables you expect D&T to complete.  If so, please add missing projects at the bottom of the document.  Add missing Aims, Sub-Aims, or Deliverables at the end of the associated project section (you can use the last table field in that project and just add the information the best you can).</li>
<li>Confirm the description of the Aim/Sub-Aim/Deliverable/Epics</li>
<li>Confirm/add due dates on the Aim/Sub-Aim/Deliverable/Epics if possible</li>
<li>Confirm/add the “definition of done”... this is where you can help us understand a successful outcome of the Aim/Sub-Aim/Deliverable/Epics.</li>
<li>Please pay special attention to Red Flagged items or items with a Yellow or Red confidence indicator.  These are areas where we really need your help/guidance.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once we get your feedback we will lock this document and incorporate your feedback into Smartsheets.</p>

<h2>The Result</h2>

<p>We are going to review this document/Smartsheet with you quarterly.  By completing this review, you will signal to D&T that we have captured the necessary deliverables for your project for at least the next quarter.  We will use this to confirm budgets and allocate people resources accordingly.  Our goal is to develop a shared understanding of what D&T needs to do to be successful.  It will be far from perfect the first time we do this, but the goal is to get better over time.  If we find that a lot of surprises come up mid-quarter, let's review and try to develop an understanding of what we can do differently next quarter to minimize surprise deliverables mid-quarter.
